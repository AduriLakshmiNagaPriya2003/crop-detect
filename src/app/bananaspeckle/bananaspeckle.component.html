    <p>Banana leaf speckle is a common general name given to several species of fungi that are capable of reflecting diffused circular or irregular blotches on banana leaves that come in many colors such as grey, brown, and black. 
        The blotches tend to appear on the underside of older leaves and can reach up to 5 cm in diameter. The fungi spread with the aid of wind and rain. The fungi favors cool weather, high rainfall, and a high level of shade that can usually be found where close planting took place.
        In general, banana leaf speckle is regarded as having a low risk and impact on yields. However in severe cases, if the banana leaf speckle is not controlled, the plant may suffer a loss of leaves.
        *A disease known as “fruit speckle” also exists and should not to be confused with banana leaf speckle.</p>

    <span>Cultural Treatment</span>
    <p>Sanitation: Make an effort to clean and maintain the fields’ close surroundings from weeds as often as possible. Remove and dispose of infected leaves and suckers (plants that grow not from seeds, but from buds on the root).
        Proper soil drainage: Standing water will promote the development and spread of banana leaf speckle.</p>
