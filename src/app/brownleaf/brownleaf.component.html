        <p>Brown leaf spot is a fungal disease that affects rice fields all over the world. Brown leaf spot favors high humidity, but is capable of developing in a range of temperatures.
            The fungi is more common in unflooded fields and where soils suffer nutrient-deficiencies. Important sources of brown leaf spot outbreaks are infected seeds in which the fungi are able to survive for several years and the air through the aid of wind. </p>

        <span>Cultural Treatment</span>
        <p>*Use high quality disease-free seeds<br>
            *Plant genetically resistant seed varieties<br>
            *Maintain adequate space: Avoid over-dense planting in order to allow light to penetrate<br>
            *Adequate fertilization: Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and underuse of potassium fertilizers tends to increase plants susceptibility to many diseases, such as brown leaf spot.<br>
            *The sooner the better: It is easier and more cost effective to overcome infections during the initial stage. Make a routine to monitor the field regularly and search plants for the presence of brown leaf spot.<br>
            *Sanitation: Infected plant debris must be removed at the end of cultivation in order to avoid the fungus from surviving and infecting newly planted rice. </p>
