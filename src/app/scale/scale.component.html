        <p>Armored scale insects are small pests of citrus. The eggs are laid underneath the female’s body.
            The first instar crawler searches for an adequate feeding spot on plants parts, including foliage, twigs, and fruits. They then form a protective shield separate from their bodies that appears as a whitish-like dom that eventually takes the look of a ‘nipple’.
            Infestations of armored scales will not result in the formation of sooty mold.</p>

        <span>Cultural Treatment</span>
        <p>
            Sanitation: Cut off and destroy heavily affected leaves.<br>
            The sooner the better: It is easier and more cost effective to overcome infestations during the initial stage. Make a routine to monitor the field regularly and search plants for the presence of soft scale insects.</p>
